This error occurs when using the `FlatList` component in React Native and not providing a unique `key` prop to each item in your data array.  This violates React's rendering process, leading to unpredictable behavior such as incorrect item rendering, missing items, or performance issues.  The error message itself isn't always clear, often manifesting as seemingly random rendering problems. For instance, items may not update correctly when data changes or the component may crash.

Example of buggy code:

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={[{name: 'Item 1'}, {name: 'Item 2'}, {name: 'Item 1'}]}
  renderItem={({item}) => <Text>{item.name}</Text>}
/>
```

Here, the `key` prop is missing and we have duplicate 'Item 1' entries which will lead to problems.
